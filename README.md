⚠️ Hosting Info
This chat app uses Socket.IO, which needs a backend server to work. But GitHub Pages only hosts static files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) — it can't run the server part.

To make the chat work:

Host the front-end (this code) on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service.

Host the backend server (Socket.IO) on a platform like Render, Railway, Glitch, or Vercel.
